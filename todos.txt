- [x] Make it impossible to put 2 houses on the same tile
- [ ] Variable tile size houses
	- How to set this in an extensible, not-fucky way?
	- Shared tiles of size 1 with a collider, same for grid elements and houses. 
		Each house can have multiple these colliders attached
		When placing the house, we check every collider if it collides with a free grid space
		1 base scene for a houseGhost, we can inherit from it later. It contains a node for the model, and for the colliders.
			The root of this scene is just a Node3D
			Attached to the root is a script with these methods:
				checkSlots: checks if all the colliders in the Colliders node branch are colliding with a free grid slot
					this doesn't actually need to be true - we can just check if ANY collider is NOT colliding with a free grid slot
					this could actually cause some edge cases and false positives - the ghost colliders should maybe be smaller than 1x1 unit, like 0.9x0.9 units
